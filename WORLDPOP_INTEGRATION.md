## API Endpoints

### WorldPop Population Analysis
```
POST /api/worldpop/request-population-analysis
```

**Parameters:**
- `analysisType`: Type of analysis ('Population Data', 'Population Density', 'Population Change')
- `country`: Target country name
- `year1`: Primary year for analysis
- `year2`: Secondary year for change analysis (required for Population Change)
- `selectedRoiGeometry`: Region of Interest geometry (optional)
- `resolution`: Data resolution ('100m' or '1km', default: '100m')
- `format`: Output format ('json', 'csv', 'geotiff', default: 'json')

## Usage Examples

### 1. Get Current Population Data
```typescript
// Request population data for Germany in 2020
const request = {
  analysisType: "Population Data",
  country: "Germany",
  year1: "2020",
  resolution: "100m",
  format: "json"
};
```

### 2. Analyze Population Density
```typescript
// Analyze population density for India in 2021
const request = {
  analysisType: "Population Density",
  country: "India",
  year1: "2021",
  resolution: "1km",
  format: "json"
};
```

### 3. Study Population Changes
```typescript
// Compare population changes in Brazil from 2010 to 2020
const request = {
  analysisType: "Population Change",
  country: "Brazil",
  year1: "2010",
  year2: "2020",
  resolution: "100m",
  format: "json"
};
```
