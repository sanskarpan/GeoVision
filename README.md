# Chat2Geo: A ChatGPT-Like Web App for Remote-Sensing-Based Geospatial Analysis

Chat2Geo is a Next.js 15 application providing a chatbot-like user interface for performing remote-sensing-based geospatial analyses. It leverages Google Earth Engine (GEE) in the backend to process and analyze various remote sensing datasets in real time. Users can upload their own vector data, run advanced geospatial queries, and integrate the results with an AI Assistant for specialized tasks such as **land cover mapping**, **change detection**, and **air pollutant monitoring**. 

Chat2Geo also has advanced knowledge retrieval based on Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which can integrate geospatial analysis with non-geospatial/textual information. 

The app also has authentication and database integrations, making it almost a complete package. 

Chat2Geo inherits a large portion of its building blocks from the GRAI 2.0 app that is under development at GeoRetina (www.georetina.com). In parallel with GRAI 2.0 (which will be merged to Chat2Geo once it's stable), we will also keep Chat2Geo updated for the community.

## Tech Stack üíª
- Next.js
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP):
   - Google Earth Engine (remote-sensing data invocation and processing)
   - Vertex AI (custom AI vision models)
   - Cloud Run
- Vercel AI
- OpenAI (ChatGPT API)
- Supabase (database and authentication)

## Getting Started üöÄ

1. Clone the repo

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a Google Earth Engine (GEE) account and project, otherwise no analysis can be done. Note that GEE is currently only free for non-commercial use:
   - https://earthengine.google.com
   
5. Set up the environment variables

- Create a `.env.local` file (or similar) with the required credentials for:

  - Your base url:
     ```
     BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000   # Change it if you're using a different port. In production, you should set it to the url of the deployment. 
     ```
  - Google Cloud Platform (GCP):
    ```
      GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=           # API key for Google maps. You can replace Google Maps with OSM if you want.
      VERTEXTAI_ENDPOINT_BASE_URL=   # Base URL if you use your own custom models.
      GEE_CLOUD_RUN_URL=             # URL for invoking a model hosted on VertexAI using cloud functions.
      GCP_BUCKET_NAME=               # Bucket name to store the land-cover map generated by your custom model (if applicable).
      GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY=       # Service Account key needed for GEE functions, depending on your GCP configurations. Make sure it has all the required permissions to use GEE.
    ```

  - Large Language Model (LLM) API Key:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=            # It shouldn't be necessarily OpenAI, thought. You can change it to any other API supported by Vercel AI SDK. However, you need to make some changes to the Chat API route.
    ```
  - For the database & authentication, the app uses Supabase. So you need the Supabase API keys as well:

        NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
        NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=

  - If you want Esri integration, you also need the following keys in your env (skip this part if you don't want this integration):

        ARCGIS_CLIENT_ID=
        ARCGIS_CLIENT_SECRET=
        ARCGIS_REDIRECT_URI=

- For feedback submission, I just used a simple email-based pipeline based on Mailgun (skip this part if you don't want this feature):

        MAILGUN_API_KEY=
        MAILGUN_DOMAIN=
        RECIPIENT_EMAIL=
        SENDER_EMAIL=

5. Run the develpment server

       npm run dev


Visit http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

## How to Set up Supabase Database, Storage Bucket, & Authentication üõ¢Ô∏è

Supabase has a free-tier, generous plan that you can use to work with the app.

As mentioned above, the database (PostgreSQL) and authentication are both hosted on Supabase. To set up them, you can either use the local dev (https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started) or online (https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/overview).
To set up the database and Supabase auth online, you need to create a supabase project & create the required databases and auth. 
You can find the database schema of the app in the `db-schema` folder.

If you want to also use the Knowledge Base feature, you need to create a storage bucket on Supabase as well. The name of the bucket should be `documents_bucket`. This is where the PDF docs you upload to the Knowledge Base are stored. You can set up the bucket by going to the following link:
 - https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/storage/buckets

## Available Geospatial Analyses üìä

The app includes the following geospatial analyses:

| #  | Analysis Type                                    | Description |
|----|------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 1  | **Urban Heat Island (UHI) Analysis**           | Evaluates temperature variations in urban areas compared to rural surroundings. |
| 2  | **Land-Use/Land-Cover Mapping**                | Uses Google DynamicWorld to classify land cover types. |
| 3  | **Land-Use/Land-Cover Change Mapping**         | Detects changes in land use over time using Google DynamicWorld. |
| 4  | **Air Pollution Analysis** *(Not fully implemented)* | Analyzes air pollution patterns and trends. |




## Considerationsüí°
- Note that all remote-sensing geospatial analyses, at least for now, are based on GEE in this app. So, if you don't set up your GEE environment correctly, no analysis can be done.
- It should be noted that this app is not yet ready for production. The app has known bugs, and perhaps unknown ones üòÅ Some functionalities have not been implemented yet.
- I may have forgotten to include some steps in setting up the app! üòÖ If there's missing information in the instructions, please open an issue and let me know to update the instructions accordingly.
- GEE-based geospatial analyses are just simple examples of how such analyses can be implemented and added. Some of them are using data that may not be up-to-date. As a result, care should be taken while interpreting the results.
- There are parts that should be refactored or re-designed either because they could have been used/invoked in a better place, or because they should've been implemented in a much better manner.
