# 🎯 Real API Integration Status

## ✅ What's Now Working with Real Data

### **1. Traffic Analysis (TomTom API Integration)**
**File:** `app/(main)/api/urban-planning/request-infrastructure-analysis/route.ts`

**Real Data Sources:**
- ✅ **TomTom Traffic API** - Live traffic flow data
- ✅ **TomTom Incidents API** - Real-time traffic incidents
- ✅ **OpenStreetMap** - Road network data (always free)
- ✅ **OpenWeatherMap** - Weather conditions affecting infrastructure

**What You Get:**
```json
{
  "dataSource": "TomTom Traffic API",
  "additionalData": {
    "averageSpeed": "18.5 km/h",
    "totalIncidents": 7,
    "incidentBreakdown": {
      "minor": 3, "moderate": 2, "major": 2, "critical": 0
    }
  },
  "congestionHotspots": [
    {
      "congestionScore": 8.7,
      "description": "12 min delay on this route",
      "severity": "high"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **2. Green Space Analysis (Weather API Integration)**
**File:** `app/(main)/api/urban-planning/request-green-space-analysis/route.ts`

**Real Data Sources:**
- ✅ **OpenWeatherMap API** - Current weather & climate data
- ✅ **Climate Analysis** - Recommendations for green infrastructure
- ✅ **Heat Stress Analysis** - Real temperature-based vegetation health

**What You Get:**
```json
{
  "weatherIntegration": {
    "currentConditions": {
      "temperature": "28°C",
      "humidity": "65%",
      "conditions": "partly cloudy",
      "windSpeed": "3.2 m/s"
    },
    "climateRecommendations": [
      "Consider shade trees and cooling vegetation",
      "Good conditions for diverse vegetation types"
    ],
    "dataSource": "OpenWeatherMap API"
  },
  "overallMetrics": {
    "vegetationHealth": "Good" // Dynamically adjusted based on real temperature
  }
}
```

---

### **3. Comprehensive API Status Tracking**

**Both APIs now include:**
```json
{
  "apiStatus": {
    "tomtomTraffic": true,
    "openWeatherMap": true, 
    "rapidAPI": true,
    "openStreetMap": true
  }
}
```

## 🧪 How to Test the Real Integrations

### **Method 1: Quick Test Script**
```bash
node scripts/test-real-apis.js
```

This will test both APIs and show you:
- ✅ Which API keys are configured
- ✅ Whether real data is being returned
- ✅ Sample output from each integration

### **Method 2: Chat Interface Testing**

**Traffic Analysis Prompts:**
```
"Analyze traffic congestion in Manhattan, New York. Show me the worst traffic hotspots."

"I need flyover recommendations for downtown Los Angeles based on real traffic data."

"Study traffic patterns in Chicago and recommend infrastructure improvements."
```

**Green Space Analysis Prompts:**
```
"Analyze green space coverage in Central Park area with current weather conditions."

"Assess urban heat island effects in Phoenix, Arizona during summer."

"Plan heat mitigation strategies for downtown Miami considering local climate."
```

### **Method 3: Direct API Testing**
```bash
# Test Traffic Analysis
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/urban-planning/request-infrastructure-analysis \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "analysisType": "Traffic Congestion Hotspots",
    "infrastructureType": "Roads and Highways", 
    "selectedRoiGeometry": {
      "type": "Polygon",
      "coordinates": [[[-74.0059, 40.7128], [-74.0059, 40.7589], [-73.9441, 40.7589], [-73.9441, 40.7128], [-74.0059, 40.7128]]]
    }
  }'

# Test Green Space Analysis  
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/urban-planning/request-green-space-analysis \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "analysisType": "Green Space Coverage Assessment",
    "vegetationIndex": "NDVI",
    "selectedRoiGeometry": {
      "type": "Polygon", 
      "coordinates": [[[-118.2437, 34.0522], [-118.2437, 34.0722], [-118.2237, 34.0722], [-118.2237, 34.0522], [-118.2437, 34.0522]]]
    }
  }'
```

## 🔍 How to Verify Real Data vs Mock Data

### **Real TomTom Traffic Data Indicators:**
- ✅ `"dataSource": "TomTom Traffic API"`
- ✅ Speed data in km/h (e.g., "18.5 km/h")
- ✅ Actual incident counts and breakdowns
- ✅ Real-time congestion scores

### **Mock/Fallback Data Indicators:**
- ⚠️ `"dataSource": "Mock data - TomTom API key not configured"`
- ⚠️ `"dataSource": "TomTom API (fallback data)"` (API failed)
- ⚠️ Generic location coordinates

### **Real Weather Data Indicators:**
- ✅ `"dataSource": "OpenWeatherMap API"`
- ✅ Actual temperature, humidity, wind data
- ✅ Climate-specific recommendations
- ✅ Dynamic vegetation health based on temperature

### **Mock Weather Data Indicators:**
- ⚠️ `"status": "Weather data unavailable - API not configured"`
- ⚠️ `"fallback": "Using climate-neutral analysis"`

---

## 🔑 API Key Configuration Status

### **Currently Set Up:**
```bash
OSM_BASE_URL=https://overpass-api.de/api/interpreter  # ✅ Always available (free)
TOMTOM_API_KEY=your-tomtom-key                        # ✅ You added this
RAPIDAPI_KEY=your-rapidapi-key                        # ✅ You added this  
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your-openweather-key              # ✅ You added this
```

### **API Endpoints Using Real Data:**
- 🚗 **Traffic Analysis** → TomTom + OpenStreetMap + Weather
- 🌳 **Green Space Analysis** → OpenWeatherMap + Climate Analysis
- 🏠 **Property Analysis** → RapidAPI (ready for when you need it)

---

## 🎯 Expected Performance Improvements

### **Before (Mock Data):**
- Static, unrealistic values
- No real-time conditions
- Generic recommendations
- No weather considerations

### **After (Real APIs):**
- ✅ **Live traffic speeds and incidents**
- ✅ **Current weather affecting analysis**
- ✅ **Dynamic vegetation health based on temperature**
- ✅ **Climate-specific recommendations**
- ✅ **Real road network data from OpenStreetMap**

## 🚀 What to Test Next

### **1. Different Geographic Locations:**
- **High Traffic Cities:** NYC, LA, London, Tokyo
- **Hot Climate Cities:** Phoenix, Miami, Dubai
- **Cold Climate Cities:** Minneapolis, Toronto, Moscow

### **2. Different Analysis Types:**
- **Infrastructure:** Flyover requirements, road density
- **Green Space:** Heat mitigation, tree canopy analysis
- **Comprehensive:** Infrastructure gap analysis

### **3. Weather Conditions:**
- Test during different weather (hot/cold/rainy days)
- See how recommendations change with temperature
- Verify heat stress indicators work

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **If TomTom Data Not Working:**
1. Check API key: `echo $TOMTOM_API_KEY`
2. Verify account status on TomTom developer portal
3. Check rate limits (you might have exceeded free tier)
4. Look for error logs in console

### **If Weather Data Not Working:**
1. Check API key: `echo $OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`
2. Verify OpenWeatherMap account is active
3. Test geographic coverage (some remote areas not covered)

### **Common Issues:**
- **Rate Limits:** Both APIs have usage limits
- **Geographic Coverage:** Not all regions have complete data
- **API Downtime:** Services occasionally have outages
