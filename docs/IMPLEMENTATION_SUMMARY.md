## üöÄ How to Test the Implementation

### Quick Start Testing

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test infrastructure analysis via API:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/urban-planning/request-infrastructure-analysis \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "analysisType": "Flyover and Bridge Requirements",
       "infrastructureType": "Roads and Highways",
       "selectedRoiGeometry": {
         "type": "Polygon",
         "coordinates": [[[-74.0059, 40.7128], [-74.0059, 40.7589], [-73.9441, 40.7589], [-73.9441, 40.7128], [-74.0059, 40.7128]]]
       }
     }'
   ```

3. **Test via chat interface:**
   - Navigate to your chat interface
   - Draw an ROI on the map
   - Ask: "Analyze where we need flyovers in this area"
   - Ask: "Show me investment opportunities for residential properties"
   - Ask: "Map flood risks for a 100-year storm event"

### Run Automated Tests

```bash
# Run all urban planning tests
npm test tests/urban-planning-api.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run specific analysis type
npm test -- --testNamePattern="Infrastructure Analysis"
```
